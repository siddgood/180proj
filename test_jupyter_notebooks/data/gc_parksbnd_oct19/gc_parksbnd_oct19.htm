<tr>
<td>
This dataset contains 2019 Parks and Recreational Facilities boundary information for the State of Florida. This parks layer focuses mainly on county and locally owned parks, for state and federally owned parks please use the Florida Natural Areas Inventory; Florida Managed Lands (FLMA) layer available on FGDL. This dataset is a combination of parks and recreational facility locations from over 65 different sources. The data contains selected fields denoting the name, physical address, and other facility information for parks located in Florida. This data is meant to be used for planning purposes only and is not intended to represent a 100% inventory of parks in Florida.  Park locations that have been verified are marked with the letter V in the FLAG field.  Please Note: Campground, Boat Ramp and Trailhead boundary information is often generalized and not exact. This is an update to the FGDL layer GC_PARKSBND_MAY19.shp

Florida's Outdoor Recreation Inventory

The Florida Outdoor Recreation Inventory (FORI) is a comprehensive inventory of 
the existing outdoor recreation resources and facilities in Florida. The inventory 
provides details regarding parks, recreation areas, open spaces and other outdoor 
recreation sites in the state. FORI includes the known outdoor recreation resources
and facilities provided by federal, state, regional, county and municipal 
governments, commercial enterprises, non-profit organizations and clubs. 
The database consists of over 13,000 records and is maintained by the Florida 
Department of Environmental Protection for the purpose of developing the 
Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan (SCORP).

The Florida Geographic Data Library is a collection of Geospatial Data
compiled by the University of Florida GeoPlan Center with support from
the Florida Department of Transportation. GIS data available in FGDL is
collected from various state, federal, and other agencies (data sources)
who are data stewards, producers, or publishers. The data available in
FGDL may not be the most current version of the data offered by the
data source. University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no guarantees
about the currentness of the data and suggests that data users check
with the data source to see if more recent versions of the data exist.

Furthermore, the GIS data available in the FGDL are provided 'as is'.
The University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no warranties, guaranties
or representations as to the truth, accuracy or completeness of the data
provided by the data sources. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center
makes no representations or warranties about the quality or suitability
of the materials, either expressly or implied, including but not limited
to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, or non-infringement. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center
shall not be liable for any damages suffered as a result of using,
modifying, contributing or distributing the materials.

A note about data scale: 

Scale is an important factor in data usage.  Certain scale datasets
are not suitable for some project, analysis, or modeling purposes.
Please be sure you are using the best available data. 

1:24000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
county level.
1:24000 data should NOT be used for high accuracy base mapping such
as property parcel boundaries.
1:100000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
multi-county or regional level.
1:125000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
regional or state level or larger.

Vector datasets with no defined scale or accuracy should be
considered suspect. Make sure you are familiar with your data
before using it for projects or analysis. Every effort has been
made to supply the user with data documentation. For additional
information, see the References section and the Data Source Contact
section of this documentation. For more information regarding
scale and accuracy, see our webpage at:

<strong><b>DATA LINEAGE SUMMARY: </b></strong>

<table width="60%">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
The GeoPlan Center performed the following steps in order to create the 2009 
statewide parks data layer.

43 Different Sources Comprise the Parks Dataset.

The following Sources were either reprojected to the FGDL Albers NAD83 HPGN 
map projection or if no spatial data existed they were geocoded to a statewide 
2008 TeleAtlas Streets dataset.  For downloaded county and district wide polygon 
layers the label points were created and then used for each facility.

Once the point sources were created via geocoding or reprojected existing point 
data they were merged into one statewide layer.

Record (facility) duplications were removed by manually viewing and editing the 
statewide layer's attribute table for each of the 67 counties.  Where record 
duplication existed source information of previously corrected FDOT Districts and 
Regional Planning Council data took preference followed by, County data, State Data, 
Federal data, and finally geocoded data.

Below are the data Sources as described in the Source field in the attribute table.

Next GeoPlan Center performed the following attribute table adjustments.

-Upper cased all records.
-Added DESCRIPT field based on NAME
-Socio-Cultural Effect data fields and definitions were added. 
 FLAG, UPDATE_DAY, NAME, ADDRESS, CITY,
 ZIPCODE, OPERATING, OP_CLASS, SERVICES, COMMON_USE
 USE, YR_BUILT, FGDLAQDATE.
Process Date: 20090326
<br />
The GeoPlan Center performed the following steps in order to create the January 2014 
statewide parks data layer.

Downloaded and Reprojected (FGDL Albers) New Data:  
See New Data Sources (next process step).

Using the newly downloaded data and the original gc_parks_mar09.shp data, 
GeoPlan created a statewide parks boundary layer.

Next using County and City Websites, along with the FDEP ORP Inventory 
Website (http://appprod.dep.state.fl.us/www_orp/Total/Total_Q.asp) 
GeoPlan located and mapped missing parks using imagery and 
2010-2012 parcel date for the following 52 Counties:

ALACHUA, BAKER, BAY, BRADFORD, CALHOUN, CITRUS, CLAY, COLLIER, 
COLUMBIA, DESOTO, DIXIE, DUVAL, ESCAMBIA, FLAGLER, FRANKLIN, 
GADSDEN, GILCHRIST, GLADES, GULF, HAMILTON, HARDEE, HENDRY, 
HERNANDO, HIGHLANDS, HILLSBOROUGH, HOLMES, INDIAN RIVER, 
JACKSON, JEFFERSON, LAFAYETTE, LEON, LEVY, LIBERTY, MADISON, 
MARION, MONROE, NASSAU, OKALOOSA, OKEECHOBEE, PASCO, 
PINELLAS, PUTNAM, SANTA ROSA, SEMINOLE, ST JOHNS, SUMTER, 
SUWANNEE, TAYLOR, UNION, WAKULLA, WALTON, and WASHINGTON.

The remaining 15 counties will be updated in the next data update/review cycle 2014/2015:

BREVARD, BROWARD, CHARLOTTE, LAKE, LEE, MANATEE, MARTIN, 
MIAMI-DADE, ORANGE, OSCEOLA, PALM BEACH, POLK, SARASOTA, 
ST LUCIE, and VOLUSIA

Removed the majority of State and Federal Parks in order to decrease duplication 
between this layer and the FNAI Florida Managed Lands (FLMA) FGDL layer. Some 
overlap still remains, predominately at NPS project sites.

Park locations were checked using imagery and Google Street View and either 
marked as Verified or Not Verified in the FLAG field, please see the FLAG field
Attribute Definition for more information.

During the Spatial and Tabular QAQC duplicates were removed.

Below are the new data Sources as described in the Source field 
in the attribute table for this update.
