<strong><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION:</b></strong>
<table width="650">
<tr>
<td>
This dataset contains the boundaries of Florida's 67 counties. The interior county boundaries are from the US Census Bureau's TIGER data. The coastal boundaries are from the previous version of CNTBND and are used by Florida Department of Transportation's Efficient Transportation Decision Making (ETDM) process for display purposes.

GeoPlan maintains 3 county boundary layers: COUNTYSHORE_AREAS, CNTBND, and COUNTY. These 3 layers will all have the same interior 
boundaries and different coastal boundaries. The interior boundaries come 
from the MAF/TIGER Database that is updated yearly by the US Census Bureau. 
The coastal boundaries differ in the following way:

1)      COUNTYSHORE_AREAS - FWRI's detailed shoreline layer (updated 
        periodically)

2)      CNTBND - moderately generalized shoreline designed for ETDM display, 
         sourced from historic US Census Bureau data

3)      COUNTY - highly generalized shoreline designed for ETDM display, 
         sourced from historic US Census Bureau data

<strong><b>USER NOTES:</b></strong>
<br />
<table width="500">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
Certain node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain relationships are 
collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements. Some of these 
requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains must connect 
to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through nodes, left and right 
GT-polygons are defined for each chain element and are consistent throughout 
the transfer, and the chains representing the limits of the file (neatline) are free of 
gaps. The neatline is generated by connecting the four corners of the digital file, 
as established during initialization of the digital file.  All data outside the enclosed 
region are ignored and all data crossing these geographically straight lines are 
clipped at the neatline. (Exception: During the QA/QC process all data is 
examined and if errors are found and corrections are possible, then data is 
corrected accordingly.  This process is documented in the Process_Step.)  Data 
within a specified tolerance of the neatline are snapped to the neatline. Neatline 
straightening aligns the digitized edges of the digital data with the generated 
neatline, that is, with the longitude/latitude lines in geographic coordinates.  All 
internal polygons are tested for closure.  Certain attributes and/or entities, e.g. 
closure line, convey data quality information.  When information to be encoded in 
the subfield is known to be not applicable (undefined, not relevant), then the 
subfield is valued by a string of "9s"; and when the information to be encoded is 
relevant but unknown (or missing), then the subfield is valued by a string of "9s."

The Florida Geographic Data Library is a collection of Geospatial Data
compiled by the University of Florida GeoPlan Center with support from
the Florida Department of Transportation. GIS data available in FGDL is
collected from various state, federal, and other agencies (data sources)
who are data stewards, producers, or publishers. The data available in
FGDL may not be the most current version of the data offered by the
data source. University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no guarantees
about the currentness of the data and suggests that data users check
with the data source to see if more recent versions of the data exist.

Furthermore, the GIS data available in the FGDL are provided 'as is'.
The University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no warranties, guaranties
or representations as to the truth, accuracy or completeness of the data
provided by the data sources. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center
makes no representations or warranties about the quality or suitability
of the materials, either expressly or implied, including but not limited
to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, or non-infringement. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center
shall not be liable for any damages suffered as a result of using,
modifying, contributing or distributing the materials.

A note about data scale: 

Scale is an important factor in data usage.  Certain scale datasets
are not suitable for some project, analysis, or modeling purposes.
Please be sure you are using the best available data. 

1:24000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
county level.
1:24000 data should NOT be used for high accuracy base mapping such
as property parcel boundaries.
1:100000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
multi-county or regional level.
1:125000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
regional or state level or larger.

Vector datasets with no defined scale or accuracy should be
considered suspect. Make sure you are familiar with your data
before using it for projects or analysis. Every effort has been
made to supply the user with data documentation. For additional
information, see the References section and the Data Source Contact
section of this documentation. For more information regarding
scale and accuracy, see our webpage at:

<strong><b>DATA LINEAGE SUMMARY: </b></strong>
<br />
<table width="60%">
<tr>

<pre>
This data layer was originally created by the US Census Bureau. 
The GeoPlan Center acquired this dataset from the Florida Department 
of Environmental Protection GIS Division. This dataset was previously 
released in FGDL Version 3 (released July 2000), and there was an 
error in the eastern border of Polk County/ western border of Osceola. 
The border has been corrected and updated for this new version of the 
dataset.
Process Date: 2002
<br />
The originating agencies created the original spatial coverage. 
GeoPlan, during the QA/QC process included the following aspects:

(1) Reprojected data to FGDL Albers
(2) Set Precision to DOUBLE
(3) Set Tolerances to FGDL Standards.
(4) Changed DADE county name to MIAMI-DADE; also changed FIPS code from 13 to 86
Process Date: 2002
<br />
GeoPlan corrected Hernando and Sumter County boundaries in September 2004.
Process Date: 20040900
<br />
Dissolved layer based on county name in order to convert single part shapes to 
multipart shapes. This reduced the polygon count to 67. In addition, deleted small 
island polygons that had name Franklin but were located on the western border of 
Wakulla County.
Process Date: 20080612
<br />
Fixed Palm Beach / Broward border. Made corrections based on the following two layers:
fl_countyshore.shp (FDEP)
CountyBoundary.shp (Broward County GIS)
Process Date: 20110601
<br />
Fixed Gulf/Franklin boundary based on 2011 TIGER Line shapefile. Renamed 
output to CNTBND_JUL11. The July 2011 date tag comes from the source date of 
TIGER data. This date also matches FGDL layer countyshore_areas_jul11.shp, 
which also comes from TIGER.
Process Date: 20120423
<br />
This layer is made up of 2 sources.

1) The interior county lines are derived from the latest TIGER county boundary. This 
can be downloaded here:
ftp://ftp2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2015/COUNTY/

2) The coastal boundary was taken from CNTBND_JUL11.

Major changes to boundaries include the following:
Gulf/Franklin
Martin/St. Lucie

Other minor changes can be seen around the state because of the new method of 
replacing all interior boundaries with the latest TIGER data. In past versions of 
CNTBND only the major changes were made.

Python script county_boundaries.py was used to do the following:
-Used Dissolve, Intersect, and Spatial Join command to replace interior boundaries 
with updated TIGER boundaries
-Add TIGERNAME field based on county name in TIGER data
-Add DESCRIPT field based on county name
-Add FGDLAQDATE based on date acquired from source
